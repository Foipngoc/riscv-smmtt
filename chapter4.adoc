== `Smmtt`: Hart MTT Extension

=== Smmtt[34, 46, 56]rw

The `MTTPPN` rooted structure for the MTT is shown below. The structure
below shows a 56 bit physical address lookup; for lower physical address
widths e.g. 46 bits, the `MTTL3` table is not applicable. In this mode of the
Smmtt[34, 46, 56]rw, each page is associated with a read and a write access
permission (2 bits). <<mtt-map-rw>> shows the Physical address (PA) being
used to index into the `MTT` structure in memory to lookup access
permissions for the supervisor domain specified in the `MTTL1` entry.
Intermediate `MTTL3` and `MTTL2` entries are used to allow this structure to
be sparsely populated.

{reg: [
  {bits:  44, name: 'MTTL2 PPN'},
  {bits:  20, name: 'ZERO'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}

  {bits:  4, name: 'TYPE'},
  {bits:  16, name: 'ZERO'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

The `ZERO` field must always be 0.

The `TYPE` field determines the interpretation of the `MTTL2` entry. The
`TYPE` field encoding is as follows:

* 0000b - `1G_disallow` - read and write access is not allowed for the 1G
range for this supervisor domain
* 0001b - `1G_allow_r` - read access for the 1G range is allowed for the
supervisor domain
* 0011b - `1G_allow_rw` - read and write access for the 1G range is allowed
for the supervisor domain
* 0100b - `MTT_L1_DIR` - The 32M range is composed of 8192x4K pages
* 0111b - `2M_PAGES` - The 32M range is composed of 16x2M pages
* All other encodings are `reserved` and cause an access violation

The `INFO` field depends on the `TYPE` field and is formatted as per the
following table:

.`MTTL2` Entry Type for Smmtt
[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|*`MTTL2` Entry `TYPE`* |*Description, `INFO` and `TYPE` field encoding*
|`1G_disallow` a|
_The 1G range of address is not allowed for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`1G_allow_r` a|
_The 1G range of address is allowed (read only) for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.
The INFO field must be 0.

|`1G_allow_rw` a|
_The 1G range of address is allowed (read/write) for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 32 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 32M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`MTT_L1_DIR` a|
The `INFO` field provides the PPN of the `MTTL1` page.
Entries of the `MTTL1` page hold a 4-bit `PERM` (permissions) field to indicate
the access for the supervisor domain (described in the `MTTL1` entry
<<mtt-l1-rw>>).

|`2M_PAGES` a|
_The 32M range of address space is partitioned into 2M pages where each
page has read/write access allowed/not._
The `INFO` field 31:0 holds 2 `PERM` bits per 2M address range to indicate
`access_disallowed` (00b), `read_allowed` (01b), `read_write_allowed` (11b);
(10b is `reserved`). Bits 32:43 are reserved and must be zero.

`MTTL1` table is populated if protection granularity of the 4KiB page is
desired for the supervisor domain.

`MTTL1` entry is indexed using PA[24:12] and each entry is a 4-bit `PERM` field
in the referenced page. The bits 24:16 are used to select a 64-bit field
in the page and bits 15:12 are used to select a 4 bit `PERM` field in those 64
bits. Thus, there are 4 `PERM` bits for each 4 KiB page. The encoding of `PERM`
is as follows:

* 0000b - the 4K page specifies access is *not allowed* for the domain
* 0001b - the 4K page specifies *read* access is allowed for the domain
* 0011b - the 4K page specifies *read* and *write* access is allowed for the
domain
* Remaining encodings are *reserved* and cause an access violation.

=== Smmtt[34, 46, 56]

The MTTPPN rooted structure for the MTT is shown below. The structure
below shows a 56 bit physical address lookup; for lower physical address
widths e.g. 46 bits, the L3 table is not applicable. In this mode of the
SmmttX, each page is associated with an access allowed/disallowed
permission (1 bit) to allow for efficient caching.

....

The `ZERO` field must always be 0.

The `TYPE` field determines the interpretation of the `MTTL2` entry. The
`TYPE` field encoding is as follows:

* 00b - `1G_disallow` - access to the 1G range is disallowed
* 01b - `1G_allow` - access to the 1G range is allowed
* 10b - `MTT_L1_DIR` - The 64M range is composed of 16384x4K pages
* 11b - `2M_PAGES` - The 64M range is composed of 32x2M pages

The `INFO` field depends on the `TYPE` field and is formatted as per the table:

The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 16 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 64M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`1G_disallow` a|
_The 1G range of address is not allowed for the domain._
The `INFO` field must be 0.
When configuring 1G ranges, RDSM ensures that 16 `MTTL2` entries, each
corresponding to 64M of address space, have identical `TYPE` field values.

|`MTT_L1_DIR` a|
The `INFO` field provides the PPN of the `MTTL1` page.
Entries of the `MTTL1` page hold a 2-bit `PERM` field to indicate the access
for the supervisor domain (described in the `MTTL1` entry <<mtt-l1>>).

|`2M_PAGES` a|
_The 64M range of address space is partitioned into 2M pages where each
page has access allowed/not._
The `INFO` field bits 31:0 holds 1 bit per 2M address range to indicate
access disallowed(0b) or allowed (1b). `INFO` field bits 43:32 are
reserved (must be zero).

`MTTL1` table is populated if 4KiB page confidential pages are required
for the supervisor domain.

`MTTL1` entry is indexed using PA[25:12] and each entry is a 2-bit `PERM` field
in the referenced page. The bits 25:16 are used to select a 64-bit field
in the page and bits 16:12 are used to select a 2 bit `PERM` field in those 64
bits. Thus, there are 2 `PERM` bits for each 4 KiB page. The encoding is as
follows:

* 00b - the 4K page specifies access is *not allowed* for the domain
* 01b - the 4K page specifies access is *allowed* for the domain
* 1xb - *reserved* (access causes access violation).

=== Access Enforcement and Fault Reporting

As shown in <<mtt-lookup>>, MTT lookup composes with, but does not require,
page-based virtual memory (MMU, IOMMU) and physical memory protection mechanisms
(PMP, Smepmp, IOPMP). When paging is enabled, instructions that access virtual
memory may result in multiple physical-memory accesses, including (implicit
S-mode) accesses to the page tables. MTT checks also apply to these implicit
S-mode accesses - those accesses will be treated as reads for translation and as
writes when A/D bits are updated in page table entries when `Svadu` is
implemented.

MTT is checked for all accesses to physical memory, including accesses that have
undergone virtual to physical memory translation, but excluding MTT structure
accesses. MTT structure accesses are subject to PMP/Smepmp/IOPMP checks. The MTT
checker indexes the MTT using the physical address of the access to lookup and
enforce the access permissions. A mismatch of the access type and the access
permissions specified in the MTT entry that applies to the accessed region is
reported as a trap to the RDSM which may report it to a supervisor domain. To
enable composing with Sv modes, the MTT supports configuration at supported
architectural page sizes. MTT violations manifest as instruction, load, or
store access-fault exceptions. The exception conditions for MTT are checked when
the access to memory is performed.

=== Caching of MTT and Supervisor Domain Fence Instruction

<<mfence-spa>> describes the canonical behavior of the `MFENCE.SPA` instruction
to invalidate cached access-permissions for all supervisor domains, a specific
supervisor domain, or a specific physical address for a supervisor domain.

<<minval-spa>> implemented with `Sinval` describes a finer granular invalidation
of access-permission caches.

When `Smmtt` is implemented, an `MTT` structure is used to specify
access-permissions for physical memory for a supervisor domain, the `MTT`
settings for the resulting physical address (after any address translation) may
be checked (and possibly cached) at any point between the address translation
and the explicit memory access. If caching is occuring, when the `MTT` settings
are modified, `M-mode` software must synchronize the cached `MTT` state with the
virtual memory system and any `PMP`, `MTT` or address-translation caches, as
described via <<mfence-spa>> or in a batched manner via <<minval-spa>>.

When used with the `MTT`, the `MFENCE.SPA` is used to synchronize updates to
in-memory MTT structures with current execution. `MFENCE.SPA` in this case,
applies only to the memory tracking table data structures controlled by the
CSR `mttp`. Executing a `MFENCE.SPA` guarantees that any previous stores already
visible to the current hart are ordered before all implicit reads by that hart
done for the `MTT` for non-M-mode instructions that follow the `MFENCE.SPA`.

When `MINVAL.SPA` is used, access-permission cache synchronization may be
batch optimized via the use of the sequence `SFENCE.W.INVAL`, `MINVAL.SPA` and
`SFENCE.INVAL.IR`.

[NOTE]
====
MTT lookups that began while `mttp` was active are not required to complete or
terminate when `mttp` is no longer active, unless a `MFENCE.SPA` instruction
matches the `SDID` (and optionally, `PADDR`) is executed. The `MFENCE.SPA`
instruction must be used to ensure that updates to the `MTT` data structures are
observed by subsequent implicit reads to those structures by a hart.
====

If `mttp.MODE` is changed for a given SDID, a `MFENCE.SPA` with rs1=x0 and rs2
set either to x0 or the given SDID, must be executed to order subsequent PA
access checks with the `MODE` change, even if the old or new `MODE` is `Bare`.
