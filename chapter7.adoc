== `Smsdia`: Supervisor Domains Interrupt Assignment

=== Initialization

Each supervisor domain is associated with its dedicated IMSIC S-interrupt file
or an APLIC domain. A supervisor domain is not aware of the existence of
another domain. Each supervisor domain interacts with its assigned interrupt
controller instance as defined by the AIA <<R3>> architecture without any change
to its interface and behavior. MTT (or PMP) is used to restrict a supervisor
domain (and its devices) to its memory mapped registers. Wires are expected to
be connected statically or configurable to APLICs.

=== Operation

All Supervisor Domain external interrupts are reflected in a new M-mode CSR
`msdeia`. The SDID programmed on the hart selects the external interrupt for
the hart from msdeia. M-mode can be interrupted using a new local interrupt
`msdeip`, that indicates if any of the supervisor domain external interrupts
are pending. External interrupts to a supervisor domain can be masked using
new M-mode CSR `msdeie`. M-mode can use the `msdeip` interrupt for scheduling
decisions. IMSIC CSRs: siselect, sireg, stopei operate on S-mode interrupt
register file selected per the hart SDID.

=== Other considerations

* Local interrupts - LCOFI, high/low priority RAS can be delegated, context
switched or virtually injected normally to supervisor domain by M-mode software.

* Timer interrupt - stimecmp for a supervisor domain is context-switched.
M-mode can use its timer for deadlines associated with non-scheduled supervisor
domains.

* Software interrupts can be handled similar to external interrupts - if
required - using a `msdsia` and `msdsie` CSR - SW interrupts are implementation
defined.
