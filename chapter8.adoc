== `Smsdedbg`: Supervisor Domain External Debug

The <<MSDCFG>> CSR contains the `sdedbgalw` bit that controls whether the
current scheduled SD is allowed to be external-debugged. This bit is context
switched (along with rest of the `msdcfg`) per SD.

When M-mode external debug is enabled, all supervisor domains may also be
debugged by an external debugger irrespective of the configuration held in
`msdcfg.SDEDBGALW`.

When M-mode external debug is disabled, whether execution at privilege modes
less than `M-mode` may be debugged by an external debugger depends on the
configuration held in `msdcfg.SDEDBGALW`.

When `msdcfg.SDEDBGALW` = 0, external debug is disallowed. Abstract commands
and halt request from the debug module are suppressed and stay pending.

When `msdcfg.SDEDBGALW` = 1 then external debug of privilege modes less than
`M-mode` is allowed, and:

* A halt request may transition the hart to Debug Mode.
* Abstract commands and program buffer execution can access state of privilege
modes less than `M-mode`.
* Read and Write of `Sdtrig` CSRs is allowed.
* Debugger memory accesses occur with either `S-mode` or `U-mode` privilege (as
if `aamvirtual` = 1 and `MPP` != `M-mode`).

This section will be moved into the specification for external debug security.
It is described in this specification as informational.

The `medbgen` is an enable control for external debug for the M-mode driven by
the debug module and is expected to be established by the RoT (following RISC-V
Security Model recommendation SR_GEN_007 and SR_GEN_012). When privilege is `M`,
the `medbgen` gates the `haltreq` from the debug module and if is 0 prevents
the hart from entering external debug mode.

The following change is proposed to behavior of `M-mode` access to triggers with
`dmode` = 1. This change allows the RDSM to remain in control of external debug
for supervisor domains (unless the RDSM is itself under external debug).

When `medbgen` is 0 and privilege is `M-mode`:

* M-mode can read and write triggers, *including triggers with `dmode` = 1
without restrictions*.
* Abstract commands and halt request from external debugger stay pending while
privilege is `M-mode`.
* All trigger-matching is suppressed (similar to how `MIE` or `MTE` would
suppress them)

When privilege is less than `M`, the OR of the `MSDCFG.sdedbgalw` and `medbgen`
gates the `haltreq` from the debug module and the hart will enter external debug
mode if either is 1.

The configuration for `MSDCFG.sdedbgalw` may be obtained from the manifest/
configuration of the supervisoer domain and should be managed by the M-mode root
security manager using secure memory.

When `medbgen` is 1, there are no restrictions. When `medbgen` is 0 but
`MSDCFG.sdedbgalw` is 1, then the external debug mode may be entered but is
restricted by `M-mode` software to prevent privileged CSR accesses and memory
accesses by instructions executed in external debug mode cannot use `M-mode`
privilege. When `medbgen` is 0 and `MSDCFG.sdedbgalw` is also 0, the `M-mode`
root domain security manager must not configure triggers with `action=1`.
Triggers for the supervisor domain are expected to be controlled by the root
domain security manager to prevent any leakage of information.
